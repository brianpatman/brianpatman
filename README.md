Hi I'm Brian Patman, a Full-Stack Web Developer by day with a major focus on security. You can't (or shouldn't) work on a public-facing website without knowing about how to prevent common attacks and keep track on emerging vulnerabilities.

But, by night, I am a generalist and like to hop around between quite a few languages and projects, web-based and not. Python was the first programming language I ever learned, so it holds a very close place in my heart for general scripting or programming tasks.

I have skills in 
- Python
- JavaScript/JQuery
- PHP 
- WordPress

I want to learn more about
- React
- Angular
- WPEngine's Atlas platform
- Laravel
